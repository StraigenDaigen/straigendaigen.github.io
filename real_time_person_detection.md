# Real-Time Person Detection (Thesis Project)

## Description of the Project
My thesis project focused on developing a real-time person detection system using advanced computer vision techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: Main framework for model development.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Model chosen for its high accuracy and speed.
- **Surveillance cameras**: For real-time data capture.

## My Role
I developed and optimized the detection model, adjusting hyperparameters and improving system accuracy.

## Results
The system achieved 90% accuracy in real-time person detection.

## Demonstrations
