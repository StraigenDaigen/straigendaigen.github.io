# Illegal Mining Detection with Satellite Images

## Description of the Project
The goal of this project was to identify illegal mining activities in Colombia using satellite images and advanced computer vision techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV**: For model development and training.
- **AWS (S3, Lambda, SageMaker)**: For cloud storage and data processing.

## My Role
I developed the computer vision models and supervised the data labeling process to ensure dataset quality.

## Results
We achieved 85% accuracy in detecting illegal activities, contributing to academic research and practical applications.
