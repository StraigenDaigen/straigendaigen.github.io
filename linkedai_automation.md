# Automation in LinkedAI

## Description of the Project
At LinkedAI, I worked on automating the segmentation and object detection processes in images to improve the efficiency of labeling. This included the development and implementation of two key projects:

1. **Automatic Segmentation with SAM (Segment Anything Model)**
   We used SAM for precise segmentation of objects within images, significantly improving the quality and speed of labeling.

2. **Automatic Object Detection with OWL-ViT**
   We implemented OWL-ViT for automatic object detection, allowing for efficient identification and labeling of objects in large volumes of data.

## My Role
I was responsible for the implementation of these AI models in the image labeling pipeline. My work included integrating and optimizing the models to ensure optimal performance.

## Results
Thanks to these implementations, we increased the labeling speed by up to 4 times, enhancing operational efficiency and significantly reducing delivery times.
